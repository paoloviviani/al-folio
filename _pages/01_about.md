Theoretical physicist turned computer scientist. Currently Senior Researcher at [LINKS Foundation](https://linksfoundation.com/en/).

My main interests are High-Performance Computing and systems for Machine Learning/AI. Iâ€™m also interested in containers and cloud technologies for HPC and quantum computing.

Also, I'm an avid photographer.
